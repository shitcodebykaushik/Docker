# This is the complete learning pathway for the docker learning 

Compatibility is the matrix of hell for the different Web Server Database Messaging  and Orchestration  as each of them have different Libraries ,Dependencies,OS and Hardware infrastructure .
As it takes long time for the setup time and different Dec/Test/Prod environment .

To solve these issue we have Docker which helps us to run Libs and Deps seperately for the each of the componenet  ,without effecting other  and it have their own environenment .
 It run each service with its own dependencies in the seperate containers .
  ## Containers 
   It is complete isolated env and they have their own Processes,Network and Mounts for their own production at the same `OS kernel` .
   Docker utilises LFC container.
   It is low stuff to maintain the container , so fill up the gap we have Docker as High level. 
   ### Bit about OS
    Os kernal- It is responsible for communicating with underlying hardware .
    Set of software These software consist of different UI  and some other feutre which differentiate between them. 
 # Docker share  underlying Os kernal 
  linux share the os
  But windows doesn't
  Under virtual machine we can share the os vitually .
   The main purpose of docker is to package and containerzied the application to anywhere anytime .
   Vm doestnet rely on underlying os .
   Hypervisor run vm.
   We can find the image of different service at the docker hub .
# Container vs image 
Image is the package or template .It is use to create container.
Container are running instance of which have their own enviorenment .
Image is direcetly handover to the ops team for the deployment in production team .
Unlike virtual machine container not meant to host the os .
Container are meant to host the specific task .It will live as long as its process is alive.

  # Docker basic command 
 - `docker ps ` 
 - `docker -a `
 -  `docker rmi `
 - ` docker pull ngnix` 
 - `docker run ubuntu ` it  will run instance of the ubunutu image and will exixt as soon as possible
